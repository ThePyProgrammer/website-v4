Inspired by \"The Password Game,\" it requires users to meet various rules when writing commit messages, such as composing haikus, creating palindromes, or using pig latin. The extension also includes interactive elements like answering trivia questions and using facial recognition to ensure users are smiling while committing. Built using Typer, NLTK, OpenCV2, and deepface, it integrates with VSCode through a React/MUI webview interface to make git commits more engaging while preventing generic messages like \"fix: minor fix.\"",
